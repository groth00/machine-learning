taking a quick look at the NeurIPS papers from 1987-2019 by using matplotlib/seaborn to generate barplots

8/23-8/24
used SparkNLP (and normal PySpark) to perform LDA (unsupervised method to cluster documents of text)

current needs: manually adjust stopwords, filter out 1-length tokens

possible adjustment: 
lemmatize edge cases (not too important, could add those forms to the stopwords)

todo:
consider looking at gensim for more inference,
use n-gram model, 
cluster documents into a topic (argmax),
visualizations: distribution of documents into topics, distribution of topics per year, wordcloud
