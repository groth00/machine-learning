August 3, 2021: Simple Implementation of the Naive Bayes Algorithm

-- based on the pseudo-code from Speech and Language Processing, 3rd Edition Draft

-- estimates class priors and word log-likelihoods through counts

-- assigns a test document to the class with the highest probability


August 4, 2021: Binary NB

-- variation of NB that only considers whether a word appears in a document or not (hence binary)

-- edited the test function to classify multiple documents
